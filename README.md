# Paper Round

It just searches papers across all the OpenAcess conferences and indexes in a cool web page.

The filters are pretty useful too. They are sequential, so you can refine your search by adding more filters and find papers that are more relevant to you.

No AI or search engine schinanigans, just a simple search and filter.

Thanks @Hermes for the logo.
